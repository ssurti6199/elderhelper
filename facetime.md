## How to Use FaceTime: Step by Step Directions
Here are step by step directions on how to use FaceTime if the video is not loading or you prefer written directions.

### What is FaceTime?
FaceTime is an app that allows you to not only call your family members but also be able to see them live on video. 
FaceTime is available on all Apple products including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
Video calling with FaceTime is completely secure and private.

### Requirements to Use FaceTime
To be able to download FaceTime, you must have an Apple (iOS) device.
You must also have mobile data or a WiFi connection to audio or video call. Charges may be applied when using mobile data.
All Apple products support FaceTime video and audio calling except for the Apple Watch, which is only capable of FaceTime audio calls.
The family member that you are contacting must also have FaceTime downloaded and ready to use on their Apple device.

### How to Enable FaceTime
The FaceTime app is automatically downloaded on every Apple device. However, it may be disabled on your device. Here is how to make sure your FaceTime is enabled so you can make and receive calls from family members.
1. Open the Settings app on your device.
2. Scroll down the list of applications until you see FaceTime, and click on it. 
3. There will be a slider on the right side. If this slider is green, your FaceTime is enabled. If the slider is grey, click it to enable FaceTime.
4. Click on "Use Your Apple ID for FaceTime" under the slider. Log into your Apple ID.
5. Once logged into your Apple ID, select which email addresses and phone numbers you would like to be reached at when using FaceTime.
FaceTime is now enabled and you can be contacted by your family members at the selected email and phone numbers.

### Using the FaceTime App
Once FaceTime has been enabled, you can contact your family members using the app. Here is how to use the app.
1. Find the FaceTime app on your device. Tap on it to open it.
2. At the top of your screen, tap the search bar and search the name, email, or phone number of the family member that you would like to contact.
3. Tap the video camera icon to start a video call with your family member, or the phone icon to start a phone call. 

### Using FaceTime through Contacts
If you are struggling to use the FaceTime app itself, you can also use FaceTime through the Contacts app on your device.
1. Find the Contacts app on your device, and tap on it to open it.
2. At the top of your screen, tap the search bar and search the name of the family member that you would like to contact. When their name appears, tap on it to open their contact information.
3. Tap the video camera icon to begin a FaceTime call.
